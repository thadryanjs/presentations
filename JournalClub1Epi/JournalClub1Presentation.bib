  abstract = {We offer an approximation to central confidence intervals for directly standardized rates, where we assume that the rates are distributed as a weighted sum of independent Poisson random variables. Like a recent method proposed by Dobson, Kuulasmaa, Eberle and Scherer, our method gives exact intervals whenever the standard population is proportional to the study population. In cases where the two populations differ non-proportionally, we show through simulation that our method is conservative while other methods (the Dobson et al. method and the approximate bootstrap confidence method) can be liberal.},

  abstract = {Approximately 15,000 persons aged {$<$}20 years receive a cancer diagnosis each year in the United States (1). National surveillance data could provide understanding of geographic variation in occurrence of new cases to guide public health planning and investigation (2,3). Past research on pediatric cancer incidence described differences by U.S. Census region but did not provide state-level estimates (4). To adequately describe geographic variation in cancer incidence among persons aged {$<$}20 years in the United States, CDC analyzed data from United States Cancer Statistics (USCS) during 2003-2014 and identified 171,432 cases of pediatric cancer during this period (incidence = 173.7 cases per 1 million persons). The cancer types with the highest incidence rates were leukemias (45.7), brain tumors (30.9), and lymphomas (26.2). By U.S. Census region, pediatric cancer incidence was highest in the Northeast (188.0) and lowest in the South (168.0), whereas by state (including the District of Columbia [DC]), rates were highest in New Hampshire, DC, and New Jersey. Among non-Hispanic whites (whites) and non-Hispanic blacks (blacks), pediatric cancer incidence was highest in the Northeast, and the highest rates among Hispanics were in the South. The highest rates of leukemia were in the West, and the highest rates of lymphoma and brain tumors were in the Northeast. State-based differences in pediatric cancer incidence could guide interventions related to accessing care (e.g., in states with large distances to pediatric oncology centers), clinical trial enrollment, and state or regional studies designed to further explore variations in cancer incidence.},

  abstract = {The age-adjusted cancer rates are defined as the weighted average of the age-specific cancer rates, where the weights are positive, known, and normalized so that their sum is 1. Fay and Feuer developed a confidence interval for a single age-adjusted rate based on the gamma approximation. Fay used the gamma approximations to construct an F interval for the ratio of two age-adjusted rates. Modifications of the gamma and F intervals are proposed and a simulation study is carried out to show that these modified gamma and modified F intervals are more efficient than the gamma and F intervals, respectively, in the sense that the proposed intervals have empirical coverage probabilities less than or equal to their counterparts, and that they also retain the nominal level. The normal and beta confidence intervals for a single age-adjusted rate are also provided, but they are shown to be slightly liberal. Finally, for comparing two correlated age-adjusted rates, the confidence intervals for the difference and for the ratio of the two age-adjusted rates are derived incorporating the correlation between the two rates. The proposed gamma and F intervals and the normal intervals for the correlated age-adjusted rates are recommended to be implemented in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute.},
