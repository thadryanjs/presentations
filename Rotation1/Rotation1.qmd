Comments: could be even shorter, read and cite a care density paper as most people in the group haven't used it. Last meeting on the 21st.

# Introduction

## Overview

- What are some basic dispersion metrics we can infer from the EHRs?
- What proportion of patients saw differnt providers of interest? 
- What is the distribution of weights in the provider-provider network?
- What is the distribution of care density in our cohort?
- For any of the above, do we observe variation between cancer types?
- What is the distribution of weights in the provider-provider network?
- What is the distribution of care density in our cohort?
- For any of the above, do we observe variation between cancer types?

# Zip codes as a proxy for geographic dispersion

## Motivation & Logic
 
- Get a rough approximation of dispersion of patients in the network using the number of zipcode they have encounters in.
- By patient ID, how many unique zip code strings are observed?
- We observe a skewed distribution ranging from ???.

## Histogram of zip codes by patient

- What the here

# Care-team variables of interest

## Creating variables of interest

 - Did they see a surgeon?
 - Did they see a radiation oncologist?
 - Did they see a medical oncologist?
 - Determined by:
    - Getting a list of all providers they saw by NPI
    - Extracting the specialty names associated with those IDs
    - String matching relevant titles in "uniquified" list

## Creating variables of interest 2

  - Do they have a primary care in our network?
    - Get a list of all the providers they saw as in the last slide
    - Checking if a general practicioner or family care title appears
  - Did they get surgery?
  - Did they get hormone therapy?

# Creating the network

## The preliminary network analysis

- Created a physician-physician network using `igraph` for R
- Extracted the weights to asses relationships between physicians

## Edge weights between providers

- Extremely skewed distribution

## Edge weights between providers (zoomed)

- Skewed, but comprehensible with viewed without outliers

# Care density

## Pollack et al

- "To test whether patients whose providers frequently share patients with one another — what we term ‘care density’ — tend to have lower costs of care and likelihood of hospitalization."

- "9,596 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and 52,688 with diabetes who received care during 2009 - enrolled in five large, private insurance plans across the US covering employer-sponsored and Medicare Advantage enrollees"

## What is the metric?

Where:

- "n is the number of distinct doctors that patient p saw"
- "m is the total number of possible pairs of doctors"
- "w is the number of shared patients for each pair of doctors"
