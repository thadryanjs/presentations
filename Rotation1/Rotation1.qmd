Comments: could be even shorter, read and cite a care density paper as most people in the group haven't used it. Last meeting on the 21st.

# Introduction

## Overview

- What are some basic dispersion metrics we can infer from the EHRs?
- What proportion of patients saw differnt providers of interest? 
- What is the distribution of weights in the provider-provider network?
- What is the distribution of care density in our cohort?
- For any of the above, do we observe variation between cancer types?
- What is the distribution of weights in the provider-provider network?
- What is the distribution of care density in our cohort?
- For any of the above, do we observe variation between cancer types?

# Zip codes as a proxy for geographic dispersion

## Motivation & Logic
 
- Get a rough approximation of dispersion of patients in the network using the number of zipcode they have encounters in.
- By patient ID, how many unique zip code strings are observed?
- We observe a skewed distribution ranging from ???.

## Histogram of zip codes by patient

# Care-team variables of interest

## Creating variables of interest

 - Did they see a surgeon?
 - Did they see a radiation oncologist?
 - Did they see a medical oncologist?
 - Determined by:
    - Getting a list of all providers they saw by NPI
    - Extracting the specialty names associated with those IDs
    - String matching relevant titles in "uniquified" list

## Creating variables of interest 2

  - Do they have a primary care in our network?
    - Get a list of all the providers they saw as in the last slide
    - Checking if a general practicioner or family care title appears
  - Did they get surgery?
  - Did they get hormone therapy?

# Creating the network

## The preliminary network analysis

- Created a physician-physician network using `igraph` for R
- Extracted the weights to asses relationships between physicians

## Edge weights between providers
