# Introduction

 - What are some basic dispersion metrics we can infer from the EHRs?
 - What proportion of patients saw differnt providers of interest? What about combinations of those providers?
 - What is the distribution of weights in the provider-provider network?
 - What is the distribution of care density in our cohort?
 - For any of the above, do we observe variation between cancer types?

# Zip codes as a proxy for geographic dispersion

# Motivation & Logic
 
 - Get a rough approximation of dispersion of patients in the network using the number of zipcode they have encounters in.

 - By patient ID, how many unique zip code strings are observed?

 - We observe a skewed distribution ranging from 1-7.

# Creating a table 1

# Creating variables of interest

 - Did they see a surgeon?
 - Did they see a radiation oncologist?
 - Did they see a medical oncologist?
 - Determined by:
    - Getting a list of all providers they saw by NPI
    - Extracting the specialty names associated with those IDs
    - String matching relevant titles in "uniquified" list

# Creating variables of interest 2

  - Do they have a primary care in our network?
    - Get a list of all the providers they saw as in the last slide
    - Checking if a general practicioner or family care title appears
  - Did they get surgery?
  - Did they get hormone therapy?

# Creating the network

# The preliminary network analysis

- Created a physician-physician network using `igraph` for R
- Extracted the weights to asses relationships between physicians

# Edge weights between porviders

- Content

# Investigating extreme values

- Content

# We observe some extremely high value in terms of the weights

- Conent

# Do the individuals with high weight correspong to high ???

- Content

# Edge weight outliers

- Content

# Edge weight correlates with ??? in high-volume providers

- We observe the expected correlation

# Care density

- Content

 What is the distribution of weights in the provider-provider network?
 - What is the distribution of care density in our cohort?
 - For any of the above, do we observe variation between cancer types?
